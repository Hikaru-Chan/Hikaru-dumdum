        <h2 id="Story" class="title">Her Story</h2>  

        <p>She was originally and Indie Vtuber who struggled to survive, working 2-3 jobs at the same time, doing a lot of collabs, editing for others and making her own originals. 
        She did her own model and rigged it alone, she skipped meals due to not having enough money to buy food sometimes.
        Suisei felt as if her hardwork was going unnoticed which made her feel like giving up.
        Doing everything alone was tiring for her, and she was starting to feel overwhelmed.
        Suisei then went to agency hunt, with talents such as hers it would be easy to find a good agency, as long as she re-debuted as a new character and person.
        However Suisei had a single condition which made it much harder, she did not want to create another charater to re-debut. 
        Her condition was keeping the identity of Suisei, which cost her various positions on any good agency.
        During that time she started to falter, and starting to give up on streaming.
        In a last ditch effort, Suisei tried applying again to an agency she had already been declined in.
        And by a stroke of luck the agency she tried to apply to again, which was Hololive the biggest vtuber agency in the market, had just opened a second sub branch which was named Inonaka music.
        Hololive allowed Suisei to join Inonaka music with her own character, which Suisei announced to her public.
        During the Inonaka music generation Suisei was heavily ignored by the production team, with all their resources going to the main star "AzKi". 
        After some time Hololive decided to close the Inonaka music branch and merged it's members into the Hololive main branch.
        And that was when Suisei started to shine brightly, as a jack of all trades.
